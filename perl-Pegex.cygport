VERSION=0.60
RELEASE=1
CATEGORY="Perl"
SUMMARY="Perl distribution Pegex"
DESCRIPTION="Pegex is an Acmeist parser framework. It allows you to easily
create parsers that will work equivalently in lots of programming languages.
The inspiration for Pegex comes from the parsing engine upon which Perl 6 is
based on. Pegex brings this beauty to the other justmodern languages that have
a normal regular expression engine available."
